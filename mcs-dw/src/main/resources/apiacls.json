// Note that Java-style comments are allowed in this file :-)

// API declarations in this file MUST be ordered as needed to ensure that more
// specific URLs are before wildcarded URLs that would match the more specific URLs!
// Keep in mind that HTTP method will be used as part of the matching process.

// Notes:
//
//  * no field of "state-config", "role-config", or "permission-config" will deny access to the API
//
//  * all checks defined via *-config MUST return ALLOW or the API is forbidden (i.e., an implicit && is done)
//
//  * a missing *-config will *not* disallow (unless all are missing--see first bullet point)
//
//  * a missing auth-token will *not* disallow, so if a logged in user is required, some test must be made
//
//  * only *one* of each *-config is allowed
//
//  * for state-config and role-config, only *1* key is allowed (???).  if an "OR" operation
//    is required, those roles/states that are OR-ed must be comma-separated
