TODO:

* move all the setupServices() code out from dw-useracct/src/main/java/com/apixio/useracct/cmdline/*.java into
  a CmdlineUtil.java

DONE mostly * cleanup imports

DONE? * move java files to better packages...kind of mishmashed right now
  

################

GENERAL:

* kinda renamed RedisLogicBase to LogicBase (different packages...)

* kinda renamed Persistable to DaoBase (different packages...)

################

NOT NEEDED:  COMPATIBILITY:

* i could re-add com.apixio.restbase.RedisLogicBase as a passthrough to LogicBase

* i could re-add com.apixio.restbase.RedisServices as a passthrough to UserServices
