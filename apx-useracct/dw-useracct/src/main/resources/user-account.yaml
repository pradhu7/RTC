  ################ filter configuration

  # all request filters take configuration with the structure of a map from string to
  # object, where the object can be whatever structure is needed (e.g., a list or
  # map...).  One required map key is "filterClass" which refers to a class that
  # extends com.apixio.web.Microfilter

  # only 1 main filter is supported; this pattern indicates which URL requests
  # actually get filtered: (Note: static bundles might affect this design here)

  filterConfig:
    filterUrlPattern:
      - "/*"

  # requestFilters is the list of web filters that will be applied in the listed order
  # to each and every request coming in to the server:

    requestFilters:
      - com.apixio.restbase.web.RequestTimer
      - com.apixio.restbase.web.RedisTransaction
      - com.apixio.restbase.web.ValidateToken
      # the microfilters after this expect the user on the thread...
      # this won't fail if there is no token:
      - com.apixio.useracct.web.AttachUser
      - com.apixio.restbase.web.AclChecker

# authConfig.internalIP is a Java regular expression (parseable by
# java.util.regex.Pattern.compile) that defines which IP addresses are from the
# internal network.  Note that the backslash character needs to be escaped; for
# example, to treat localhost IP as internal network, the value should be (in
# quotes): "127\\.0\\.0\\..*".
#
# internalAuthTTL is the default number of seconds that an internal (request)
# token will be valid for.  This TTL is not extended by activity.
#
# maxFailedLogins is the number of failed logins (i.e., login failues in a
# row) that are allowed before setting the account to the locked-out state.
# If the value is 0 then there is no max.
