# "globalConfig" refers to configuration that is shared across ALL projects that
# conform to the new API & token/security model.  The term "global" is not meant to
# imply global to just a single project.  Note that the request filter construct
# capability is also global in the same way.

  # externalMaxTTL and internalMaxTTL specify the number of seconds after token
  # creation when the token is destroyed, regardless of activity.
  # externalActivityTimeout is the number of seconds after last activity after which
  # the token is destroyed.  Example: externalMaxTTL=86400 forces a logout after a
  # day, even with constant activity, whereas externalActivityTimeout=600 logs out
  # after 10 minutes of inactivity even if it could otherwise be kept alive for a
  # day.  internalMaxTTL and externalActivityTimeout are required and externalMaxTTL

  # all request filters take configuration with the structure of a map from string to
  # object, where the object can be whatever structure is needed (e.g., a list or
  # map...).  One required map key is "filterClass" which refers to a class that
  # extends com.apixio.web.Microfilter

  # only 1 main filter is supported; this pattern indicates which URL requests
  # actually get filtered: (Note: static bundles might affect this design here)
