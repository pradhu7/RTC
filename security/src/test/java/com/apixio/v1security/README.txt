The files in this package were copied from pre-v2 common security code (git commitid
29b3c3c621bae075a4a283d82377a9acca50fe80 works as a reference) in the package
com.apixio.security.  The package declaration was modified to be com.apixio.v1security
and the file KeyManager.java was modified so that it pulls the security key from a
Java system property "keymanager_key".
