This "fxdef" directory is where all definitions (NOT implementations!) of the various f(x)s reside.

The files under genjava and genproto and, for now, manually generated.  Note that because we need to
bridge back into existing code, some (most? all?) of the .proto files that *ought* to reside here
very well could reside elsewhere (e.g., under mono/schemas)
